# GifTastic

## How it works 

When you click on the buttons 10 tyes of gifs will pop up for that specific button. The gifs popping onto the page will have their Ratings above them (G, PG, PG-13, R). The user can also click on the gif to animate them..

## Built with 

- HTML 
- CSS
- JQUERY 
- JAVASCRIPT
- GIPHY API 



## Useful

This project is useful because it is an introduction on how to use API and shows we can use APIs in many differents ways to populate data. 

## Challenge 

Had a difficulty figuring out how to put the gifs onto the page, also took awhile to figure out the animations process. I noticed I had a lot of syntax errors, because of my spelling. I need to make sure to check over each word.
